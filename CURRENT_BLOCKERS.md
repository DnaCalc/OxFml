### BLK-FML-001: OxFunc sibling compile failure blocks OxFml validation

- **Status**: resolved
- **Impact**: blocked `W004`, `W009`, and `W010` gate closure because required `cargo test -p oxfml_core` validation could not complete
- **Current state**: subsequent rerun of `cargo test -p oxfml_core` completed successfully after the sibling compile surface recovered
- **Exact unblock steps**: completed; rerun validation succeeded
- **Recommendation**: workaround
- **Opened**: 2026-03-16
- **Resolved**: 2026-03-16
