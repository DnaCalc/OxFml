# AGENTS.md — OxFml Agent Instructions

## 1. Context Loading Order

On session start, read in this order:

1. `README.md`
2. `CHARTER.md`
3. `OPERATIONS.md`
4. `docs/spec/README.md`
5. `CURRENT_BLOCKERS.md`
6. `docs/IN_PROGRESS_FEATURE_WORKLIST.md`
7. `docs/worksets/README.md`
8. Inbound observation ledgers from consumer repos (see OPERATIONS.md Section 12.2):
   - `../OxFunc/docs/upstream/NOTES_FOR_OXFML.md`
   - `../OxCalc/docs/upstream/NOTES_FOR_OXFML.md`
9. Foundation doctrine docs (`../Foundation/CHARTER.md`, `../Foundation/ARCHITECTURE_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `../Foundation/OPERATIONS.md`)

## 2. Source-of-Truth Precedence

When guidance conflicts, precedence is:

1. `../Foundation/CHARTER.md`
2. `../Foundation/ARCHITECTURE_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md`
3. `../Foundation/OPERATIONS.md`
4. this repo `CHARTER.md`
5. this repo `OPERATIONS.md`

For OxFml-local work, treat `CHARTER.md` in this directory as the working charter.
For cross-program doctrine and architecture constraints, treat Foundation docs as authoritative.
For mutable spec work, use `docs/spec/*` in this repo.

## 3. Anti-Premature-Completion Doctrine

This section is binding. Violations are doctrine failures, not style preferences.

### Rule 1: Restricted Completion Language
The words "implemented", "closed", "done", and "complete" are forbidden when describing:
- partial subsets of declared scope,
- scaffolding, stubs, or compile-only code,
- merely enabled paths without exercised evidence,
- spec text without replay/trace evidence.

Use "in-progress", "partial", or "scaffolded" instead.

### Rule 2: Self-Audit Required Before Completion Claims
Before ANY completion claim, the agent must:
1. Run the Pre-Closure Verification Checklist from OPERATIONS.md Section 7.
2. Run the Completion Claim Self-Audit from OPERATIONS.md Section 9.
3. Include the checklist and self-audit results in the completion report.

### Rule 3: Three-Axis Reporting Mandatory
Every status report must include:
- `scope_completeness` (`scope_complete` | `scope_partial`)
- `target_completeness` (`target_complete` | `target_partial`)
- `integration_completeness` (`integrated` | `partial`)
- explicit `open_lanes` list when any axis is partial

### Rule 4: Scaffolding Is Not Implementation
Stubs, empty traits, compile-only code, and placeholder implementations are scaffolding.
Scaffolding is never reported as implementation. Report it as `scaffolded`.

### Rule 5: Spec Text Without Evidence Is Not Done
Spec or contract text without at least one deterministic replay artifact proving intended behavior is not done. Report it as `spec_drafted`.

### Rule 6: Cross-Repo Handoff Is Not Completion
Filing a handoff packet to OxCalc opens a dependency — it does not close work.
The originating item remains `in_progress` until the receiving repo acknowledges and integrates.

### Rule 7: Default to In-Progress
When uncertain whether work meets completion criteria, report `in_progress`.

## 4. Continuation Behavior

Mode: **checkpoint-at-gates** (conservative).

1. Agent must pause and report status at each workset gate boundary.
2. AutoRun is disabled by default.
3. AutoRun may only be enabled when explicitly requested by the user for a specific scope.
4. Between gates, the agent may proceed autonomously within the declared workset scope.

Rationale: premature completion is exacerbated by speed pressure. Conservative gate-pausing is the default until OxFml has 5+ completed worksets with validated gate closures.

### 4.1 Current User-Authorized Override
Current explicit user override:
1. No temporary AutoRun override is currently active.
2. Default checkpoint-at-gates behavior is in force.
3. Any future override must be explicitly user-authorized for a bounded scope and exit gate.

## 5. Blocker Handling

When a blocker is encountered:

1. Create or update `CURRENT_BLOCKERS.md` with a structured `BLK-FML-NNN` entry.
2. Continue with other non-blocked work within scope.
3. If all paths are blocked, emit a structured summary:
   - blocked items with `BLK-*` identifiers,
   - current state of each,
   - exact unblock steps required,
   - recommendation (wait / escalate / workaround).

## 6. Public Attribution Doctrine

For any issue, pull request, email response, release note, discussion post, or any other external/public-facing message authored by an agent, the first line must be an italicized attribution line.

Required format:

*Posted by [Agent] agent on behalf of @govert*

Scope exclusions (do not add attribution by default):
- internal run artifacts,
- repository documentation drafts and working notes,
- local analysis files not being published externally.

## 7. Change Discipline

1. Keep changes minimal, explicit, and testable.
2. Changes to shared seam specs (FEC/F3E contract, commit deltas, reject taxonomy, trace schema) require cross-repo impact assessment before promotion.
3. When proposing changes that affect OxCalc coordinator-facing clauses, file a handoff packet per OPERATIONS.md Section 5 and register it in `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_REGISTER.csv`.
4. Neither repo marks a seam change as "complete" until both sides acknowledge.
